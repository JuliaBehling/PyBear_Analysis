# PyBear_Analysis

## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to organize and summarize data involving a ride share app and cross-compare several metrics with 3 primary categories. IE City types; Rural, Suburban, and Urban. After the analysis was complete, the analysts created several visual aids to properly display in the information in a more digestable manner. 


## Results:

### Overall Usage:
As seen in Figure 1 & 2, ride sharing apps are significantly more common, and much more profitable, in Urban areas compared to their Rural and Suburban counterparts. Urban areas had a total amount of rides of 1,625. Whereas Rural had 125 total rudes and Suburban had 625. Total fares for Urban landed at $39,854.38 with an average individual fare being $24.53.

## Summary:

### Business Reccommendations:
Population density is a major factor in a region's likelihood to use ride sharing apps. The greater the population, the more available individuals there are to market to, and the less likely the individual is to want to deal with parking or using a car in high-density areas. Conversely, Rural and suburban areas has much more space, much less people, and more liklihood that they wil have access to their own vehicle. Reccommendations are as follows:

*  Reccommendation 1: Increase price in Urban areas.
*  Reccommendation 2: Ad campaign in Rural and Suburban areas encouraging using ride-share.
*  Reccommendation 3: Waive certain fees associatd with becoming a driver in Rural and surban city types, as to increase amount of drivers available.
